This project takes a hash primitive Foo2b and finds untargeted and targeted collisions.
It is written in elixir using mix as the project manager.
To install elixir please follow their instructions: 'http://elixir-lang.org/install.html'.
I briefly reviewed it and there is a distribution for arch-linux.
Once you have installed the elixir vm and in the root directory of the project you may run the following commands: 
1. mix bench #runs the benchmarks
2. mix test  #runs the unit tests
3. mix deps.get #installs the dependencies if not already
