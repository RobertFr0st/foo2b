# Foo2b

This is a purely elixir implimentation of Blake2b likewise named Foo2b.  This was done so as a code kata by a student learning the language, so it should not under any curcumstances be used for cryptographic security purposes.  I would direct those seeking a crypto library for elixir to erlang's openssl module.  This implimentation earned second place in a friendly targeted collision finding competition among students.

1. "mix bench" to run the benchmarks
2. "mix test"  to runs the unit tests
3. "mix deps.get" to install the dependencies if not already
